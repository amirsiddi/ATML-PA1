Just run the file on google Colab.
Just need to upload the CNN's pretrained weights from part 1 which I have also uploaded with the name "resnet50_cifar10.pth"
When it asked you to upload image 1st time, upload any image from images which I have also put in folder.
and on 2nd time upload all the photos.
Everything else is written on each code block and could be run and understood on the go
