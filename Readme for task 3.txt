Just run the file on google Colab.
Just need to upload the CNN's pretrained weights from part 1 from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sufawY2Smcki7yiIdWuBaKmVpooppv9/view?usp=sharing
When it asked you to upload image 1st time, upload any image from images which I have also put in folder.
and on 2nd time upload all the photos.
Everything else is written on each code block and could be run and understood on the go
